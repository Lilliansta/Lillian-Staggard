<h1>My Future</h1>
   <h2>It's a Hobbie?</h2>
   <p>Ever since I got into Photography I have always wanted to beconme a professional, but as I have gotten older I realise that it might be better as a hobbie or a side gig. Whether it's the thrill of chasing the perfect shot or the joy of sharing one's vision with others, photography remains a beloved hobby that enriches my life and sparks endless curiosity.</p>
<p>I'd like to keep my options open and see what other careers I can do in the media industry.</p>
<p>Other then photography I find videotography intresting too.</p>

<h2>Travel?</h2>
<p>If I was to become a photograher I'd like to be someone who travels around the world visiting different countries and admiring it's beauty.</p>
<p>As I hardly leave my backyard when taking photos I think it would be nice to get more exposure to different settuings and environments.</p>

<h2>Inspiration?</h2>
	<ul>
<li>My Father and Auntie</li>
<li>Min Heejin - Although she is not the greatest person to look up too, her artwork really speaks for its self. She has created many unique concepts and designs for many kpop artists through out her years as an art director. She may not be the one to take the photos but her ideas feel refreshing and new, her use of using vibrant colours inspires me to look at the world with open eyes taking in all the details. Min Heejin's newest creations for the Kpop group Newjeans brings out a very youthful look which has drawn attention to many, including myself. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonsoriginals/?hl=en" target="_new">Jon Purcell </a>- he creates short aesthetic videos about his travels on social media.</li>
